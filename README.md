# Healthcare Hiccups: Navigating Incidents in Cybersecurity

## Background

In the throes of a cybersecurity crisis, a small U.S. health care clinic specializing in primary care fell victim to a ransomware attack on a fateful Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m. The assailants, leveraging targeted phishing emails, infiltrated the company's network, deploying ransomware that ruthlessly encrypted vital files. The clinic's operations ground to a halt as employees grappled with inaccessible medical records and a daunting ransom note demanding a hefty sum for file decryption.

## Objectives

This project navigates the aftermath of the security incident, encapsulated in the following objectives:

1. **Incident Handler's Journal:**
   - Document the incident's phases, from detection and analysis to containment, eradication, and recovery.

2. **Packet Analysis Odyssey:**
   - Dive into the world of Wireshark, dissecting a packet capture file to unravel the intricacies of network traffic.

3. **Inaugural Packet Capture:**
   - Initiate the use of tcpdump, capturing and analyzing network traffic to enhance understanding and detection capabilities.

4. **Suspicious File Hash Interrogation:**
   - Leverage VirusTotal to scrutinize a suspicious file hash, gaining insights into potential threats and exploring preventive measures.

## Supporting Material

Refer to the [Incident Handler's Journal](https://github.com/JustinAntunes-Cardoso/Healthcare-Incident-Journal/blob/main/incident-journal/incident%20journal.md), meticulously recording findings after each activity, reflecting newfound knowledge and posing critical questions about incident prevention and response.

## Project Activities

1. **Activity: Document an Incident with an Incident Handler's Journal**
   - Chronicle the incident's evolution, delineating phases and organizational responses.

2. **Activity: Analyze Packets**
   - Employ Wireshark to dissect a packet capture file, unraveling the secrets within network traffic.

3. **Activity: Capture Packets**
   - Dive into the realm of tcpdump, capturing and filtering network traffic to enhance skills in command-line networking.

4. **Activity: Investigate a Suspicious File Hash**
   - Navigate VirusTotal's investigative prowess, analyzing a reported malicious file hash to fortify defenses against similar threats.

## Project Conclusion

In the aftermath of a crippling ransomware attack, this project serves as a testament to the multifaceted nature of incident response. From journaling the incident's progression to delving into packet analysis and suspicious file hash investigations, it lays the foundation for a robust cybersecurity stance.
