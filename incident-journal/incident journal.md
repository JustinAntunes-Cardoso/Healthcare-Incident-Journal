| Description | Documenting a cybersecurity incident This incident occurred in the two phases: <br> 1.  Detection and Analysis: The scenario outlines how the organization first detected the ransomware incident. For the analysis step, the organization contacted several organizations for technical assistance. <br> 2.  Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: The scenario details some steps that the organization took to contain the incident. For example, the company shut down their computer systems. However, since they could not work to eradicate and recover from the incident alone, they contacted several other organizations for assistance. |

| The 5 W's | ● Who: An organized group of unethical hackers <br> ● What: A ransomware security incident <br> ● Where: At a health care company <br> ● When: Tuesday 9:00 a.m. <br> ● Why: The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. |

| Description | Investigate a suspicious file hash |
| Tool(s) used | VirusTotal was utilized as an investigative tool for the analysis of files and URLs, specifically targeting potential malicious content like viruses, worms, and trojans. Functioning through a user-friendly interface, VirusTotal proves instrumental in swiftly assessing whether indicators of compromise, such as websites or files, have been flagged as malicious within the cybersecurity community. <br> <br> This incident unfolded during the Detection and Analysis phase, positioning the user as a security analyst within a Security Operations Center (SOC). Following the detection of a suspicious file hash by the implemented security systems, the task at hand involved a comprehensive analysis to validate the alert's credibility and determine the existence of an actual threat. |
| The 5 W's | ● Who: An unknown malicious actor <br> ● What: An email sent to an employee contained a malicious file attachment with the SHA-256 file hash of 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b <br> ● Where: An employee's computer at a financial services company <br> ● When: At 1:20 p.m., an alert was sent to the organization's SOC after the intrusion detection system detected the file <br> ● Why: An employee was able to download and execute a malicious file attachment via e-mail. |
| Additional notes | How can this incident be prevented in the future? Should we consider improving security awareness training so that employees are careful with what they click on? |
